# Overview
This repository will explore the use of machine learning models to predict tumor type using brain scan images.

## timeline
1. Develop prelim model to predict tumor type using brain scan images 
2. Develop new pre-processing techniques to improve prelim model performance 
3. Develop new model to predict tumor type using brain scan images using the new pre-processing techniques. This model will be compared to the prelim model. This model will also output visual characteristics that are influential for the model to choose one output over another. 
4. Develop a model that is not a neural network to predict tumor type using brain scan images. This model will be compared to the prelim model and the model developed using the new pre-processing techniques. This model will also output visual characteristics that are influential for the model to choose one output over another. 
5. Devlop a unique visualisation of the model design and steps for presentation. 
6. Develop a presentation that compares and contrasts the models developed in this project.


## Unique approaches
* Output specific visual characteristics that are influential for the model to choose one output over another.
* Unique visualisation of the model design and steps for presentation.
* Have multiple models to compare and contrast.
* Use of a model that is not a neural network.
